Find a Missing Item from Your Package
If an item is missing from your package, it may have been shipped separately.

If you received your package and an item is missing, do the following:

Go to Your Orders to see if your missing item is in another shipment.
Next to the image of your item, select Track Package to find the delivery date for this shipment.
If you still can't locate your item, contact us.
Note:
If your item is missing a part, contact the product's manufacturer for assistance. Manufacturer contact information can usually be found on the product packaging or in the paperwork included with the product. If you can't find contact information, or if they can't help, you can return the item. To do so, go to Your Orders and select Return or Replace Items.
Tracking information shows that the shipment was delivered, but you can't find it? Go to Find a Missing Package That Shows As Delivered for more information.
